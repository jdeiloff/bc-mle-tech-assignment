# 1. Model Evaluation & Alternatives

## How would you evaluate the effectiveness of this model over time?

To monitor the model's performance as new data arrives, I would implement a robust MLOps monitoring strategy:
### Performance Tracking: 
Automate the re-calculation of key metrics on new data batches (e.g., daily or weekly). The primary metric to track would be the Concordance Index (C-index). A dashboard would visualize the C-index over time to spot degradation. Grafana is a good tool for this and MLFlow for metrics tracking.

### Drift Detection:
- Data Drift: Monitor the statistical distributions of key input features (total_handle, total_deposit, reg_qp_duration). A significant shift (e.g., a new marketing campaign drastically changes the average first deposit) could invalidate the model.
- Concept Drift: Monitor the distribution of the model's output (the risk scores). A sudden change in the predicted risk profile for the user base suggests that the underlying patterns of churn are changing.
- Shadow Deployment: Deploy the new model in a "shadow mode" alongside the current production model. It would score new users without taking action, allowing us to compare its predictions and performance against the champion model on live data before promoting it.
- Automated Alerting: Set up automated alerts to notify the team if the C-index drops below a predefined threshold or if significant data drift is detected.


## What alternatives would you consider if you have more data and time?

With more resources, I would explore more sophisticated approaches to improve accuracy and business value:

- Granular Data: Move from monthly aggregated data to event-level data (e.g., every login, bet placed, deposit, withdrawal, bonus claimed).

- Advanced Feature Engineering: With event-level data, we could build much more predictive features:

- RFM Features: Recency (days since last bet), Frequency (number of active days), Monetary (total wagered, net revenue).

- Behavioral Features: Preferred betting markets/sports, average bet size, ratio of pre-match vs. in-play bets, deposit/withdrawal patterns.

- Engagement Features: Time between sessions, session duration, usage of specific product features.

### Alternative Modeling Techniques:
- Deep Learning: For sequence-aware modeling, use a Transformer or an LSTM on the sequence of user events to capture complex temporal patterns.

- Refined Churn Definition: Instead of a proxy for "early churn," define churn more directly, such as "no betting activity for 90 consecutive days." This would provide a clearer, more actionable target variable.

# 2. Production & Scale

## How would you approach running this model ~2000 times for different partners and geographies?

This requires a scalable, configurable, and automated approach. I would not create 2000 separate scripts.

- Unified Training Pipeline: Create a single, generic training pipeline. The specific partner_id and geography would be passed as parameters or configuration variables.

- Configuration-Driven: The pipeline would read a configuration file (e.g., a YAML or JSON file) that specifies the data source, feature set, and hyperparameters for a given partner/geo combination.

- Containerization: The entire training code, including all its dependencies, would be packaged into a Docker container. This ensures that the environment is consistent and reproducible everywhere it runs.

- Orchestration: Use a workflow orchestrator like Apache Airflow, Kubeflow Pipelines, or cloud-native services (AWS Step Functions, Azure Data Factory) to automatically trigger and manage the 2000 training jobs in parallel. The orchestrator would be responsible for passing the correct configuration to each job.

- Where would you save the outputs of the models? In which format?
For a batch run, outputs must be stored in a scalable and accessible manner.

### Model Artifacts:
- Storage: A centralized Model Registry (like MLflow, SageMaker/Vertex AI Model Registry) or a versioned cloud storage bucket (e.g., AWS S3, GCS).

- Format: The trained model object would be serialized into a single file using joblib (preferred for scikit-learn compatible models). The file would be named with a clear convention, e.g., gs://sportsbook-models/partner-123/geo-US-NJ/v1.0.0/model.joblib.

### Model Predictions (The Output Scores):
- Storage: A data lake (AWS S3, GCS) or a data warehouse (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift).

- Format: Parquet. This is a columnar format that is highly efficient for storage and fast to query with analytical tools. The output would be a table like (user_id, churn_risk_score, model_version, prediction_timestamp)
